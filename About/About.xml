	<description>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.

Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.

Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.

Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
